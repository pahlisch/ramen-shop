# Restaurant Dashboard Webpage
This assignment requires the creation of a webpage that displays a dashboard for a restaurant manager. The following requirements should be met:

### Requirements
* The dashboard should have a fixed navigation bar on the top of the page.
* Navigation bar should display your name on the far left and a real time clock in the format HH/MM (e.g. 14:45) on the far right.
* The dashboard should display a list of restaurants.
* Each item in the list should be a clickable object for the manager to select.
* Upon selecting a restaurant on the list, the manager is redirected to the Details page for that specific restaurant.
* Details page should display the navigation bar and the name of the restaurant. Additional content is not necessary.
* Update the README file and explain how to run the project.

### Implementation

The developer has the freedom to use any programming language and tools that they are comfortable with. Additional features, such as a restaurant search functionality is a plus. A huge plus is to host the website and include the link on the README file. Good luck!
